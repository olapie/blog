Clickhouse is a column oriented database, while MySQL, PostgreSQL are row oriented database.
Clickhouse is a Relational Database and supports SQL.   

Same column of all records are stored together,   
e.g. name:  tom:001, jim:002, lucy:003  
     score: 89:001, 90:002, 78:003  
It's a similar with MySQL index, every column is indexed, that's why it's fast to query in clickhouse. 
Each column is stored in a seperate data file.  
Refer to: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/optimize/sparse-primary-indexes  

supports composite primary key
doesn't support transaction at present

ClickHouseâ€™s limitations / weaknesses include:

    Worse query performance than TimescaleDB at nearly all queries in the Time-Series Benchmark Suite, except for complex aggregations.
    Poor inserts and much higher disk usage (e.g., 2.7x higher disk usage than TimescaleDB) at small batch sizes (e.g., 100-300 rows/batch).
    Non-standard SQL-like query language with several limitations (e.g., joins are discouraged, syntax is at times non-standard)
    Lack of other features one would expect in a robust SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB): no transactions, no correlated sub-queries, no stored procedures, no user defined functions, no index management beyond primary and secondary indexes, no triggers.
    Inability to modify or delete data at a high rate and low latency - instead have to batch deletes and updates
    Batch deletes and updates happen asynchronously
    Because data modification is asynchronous, ensuring consistent backups is difficult: the only way to ensure a consistent backup is to stop all writes to the database
    Lack of transactions and lack of data consistency also affects other features like materialized views, because the server can't atomically update multiple tables at once. If something breaks during a multi-part insert to a table with materialized views, the end result is an inconsistent state of your data.
